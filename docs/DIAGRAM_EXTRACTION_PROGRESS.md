## Extraction Strategy

For EFFICIENCY, I'll:
1. Read file
2. Identify all ```mermaid blocks
3. Extract each to separate .mmd file with descriptive name
4. Replace embedded diagram with reference link
5. Update this tracker
6. Move to next file

**Estimated time:** ~15-20 minutes for all 44 diagrams
